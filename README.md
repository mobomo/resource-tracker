POC / WIP.

For this to work you'll need a personal access token from Forecast.

Add the info to the object in `server/routes/employees.js`.

Run the server with: `PORT=3000 node server/bin/www`, if you're on Windows, start it with `set PORT=3001 && node server/bin/www`.

Run the client with: `npm start`.
